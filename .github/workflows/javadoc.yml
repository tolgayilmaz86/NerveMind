    # Since this is a multi-module project, we aggregate docs or just pick the relevant ones.

    # or if there is a root aggregated javadoc task.
    # We will attempt to consolidate them or just publish the 'app' one for simplicity initially,
    # but a better approach is often to create a custom task to copy all into one folder.
